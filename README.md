# 🔐 Secure Dice Game — Cybersecurity Edition

A security-enhanced dice game demonstrating core cybersecurity concepts:

## 🛡️ Features
- **Two-Factor Authentication (OTP System)**
- **Provably Fair Algorithm using SHA-256 Hashing**
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
- **Security Logging (security_log.txt)**
- **Secure Input Validation**
- **Cryptographic Integrity Verification**

## 🧠 Why This Project is Cybersecurity-Relevant?

This project simulates real cybersecurity workflows:

| Feature | Real-World Equivalent |
|--------|-------------------------|
| OTP / 2FA | Account login security |
| Hashing (SHA-256) | Integrity & tamper-proof proof |
| IDS (failed attempts) | Brute-force detection |
| Logging | SIEM / Incident monitoring |
| Input validation | Preventing bad input & injection |
